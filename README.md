Bubble sort, sometimes referred to as sinking sort, is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the 

input list element by element, comparing the current element with the one after it, swapping their values if needed. These passes through the list are 

repeated until no swaps had to be performed during a pass, meaning that the list has become fully sorted. The algorithm, which is a comparison sort, is 

named for the way the larger elements "bubble" up to the top of the list.  This simple algorithm performs poorly in real world use and is used primarily as 

an educational tool. More efficient algorithms such as quicksort, timsort, or merge sort are used by the sorting libraries built into popular programming 

languages such as Python and Java.[2][3]
